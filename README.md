# Fraud PHP

❓ A php website template that uses component based design and simulates Next js.

## Features

- Clean routing system.
- Reuseable component based design.
- Uses utility classes for styling.
- Has navbar and footer components and a cookie consent banner.
- Uses a custom scroll script to make the page look like one page application. That is why I call it "Fraud PHP".
- Custom metadata for each page. (Similar to Next js `Head` component)

> I created this repo because I am always following the same pattern when I create a new php project. I thought it would be nice to have a template that I can use for my future projects. I am not sure if this is the best way to do it, but it works for me. I am open to suggestions and improvements. If you have any, please let me know.
